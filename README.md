# Float64 Converter

A Python library and GUI application to convert real numbers to and from **IEEE 754 double-precision (64-bit) binary format**.  

It provides both **chopping** and **rounding** methods, allowing precise control over the conversion process, and visualizes the results for educational purposes.

## Features

- Convert **real numbers** to 64-bit IEEE 754 binary strings
- Convert IEEE 754 binary strings back to **real numbers**
- Two conversion styles:
  - **Chopping**: Truncate the mantissa bits
  - **Rounding**: Round to nearest (ties to even)
- Educational GUI with **color-coded, easy-to-read output**
- Supports **special values** like `0`, `inf`, `-inf`, and `NaN`
